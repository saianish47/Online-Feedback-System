# Online-Feedback-System

This is an appalication in java
I have used servlets and jsp. Database is MySQL and used JDBC.

Follow the directory structure by keeping web.xml and .class file of sur1.java in WEB-INF folder.

So my database name is survey and its username is "root" and no password so just change these to your credentials and create a database before running the application.
I also created 2 tables one for storing users and another for storing the responses of the users.
The name of database to store users is "users" and the responses is "usrsur".
create the table users with fields username, password, first name, last name, email
create the table usersur by fields username and followed by the number of questions you have used in your feedback form.
In this I have used 5 questions.
So thats all.
Thank you :)
